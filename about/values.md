# Values

Our values are what care about when working with each other.
Everything we do should have our values at heart.

## Kindness

Be kind in everything you do. Being kind means:

- Respecting and understanding each other.
- Helping other people.
- Being patient.
- Having empathy.
- Being polite.
- Listening to people you disagree with.
- Avoiding gossip, sarcasm, passive agressive comments, and disrespectful jokes.
- Using [nonviolent communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TONauJGfc).
- Respecting our [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Being kind is especially important in environments like ours where [asynchronous communication is the default](./how-we-work.md).
If someone isn't kind to you, please report them to people@zoonk.org or send an anonymous feedback to https://forms.gle/48UjFHCFByxCfd12A.

## Transparency

We believe education should be free and open. Therefore, everything we do must be as transparent as possible.
Being transparent allows everyone to know what's happening because we don't have "closed door" meetings.
This means all decisions and communications should be made in open forums such as GitHub Discussions, Issues, and Pull Requests.

How to be transparent:

- Communicate in public. Instead of sending an email, [start a new discussion](https://github.com/zoonk/handbook/discussions/new).
- Be clear about your intentions (say what you mean).
- Overcommunicate. Don't wait for things to be perfect to share your work. Do it from the moment you start.
- Don't use email, Slack, WhatsApp, or other private channels to discuss work.

The exception to those rules is when dealing with personal and/or sensitive data.
In those cases, please DO NOT post in public forums.

## Humility

Be hundle. Nobody knows everything.

The minute we start thinking we have all the answers, that's when we stop learning and growing.
When we don't know something, we're not afraid to say "I don't know."

This also means we work together as a team to solve problems.
When something goes wrong, we don't find someone to blame.
We're all going to make mistakes. That's okay.
We fix them. We learn from them. And we move on.
We win together and we lose together.

## No ego

We all have ego. That's okay.
But we need to be aware of it to prevent our ego from causing harm to others.
Uncontrolled, our ego can cloud our judgment.
It can make us worry about things that are not worth worrying about.

Our accomplishments are our team's accomplishments.
As mentioned earlier, we win and lose together.
We value collaboration over competition.

That's also why everything we do is open and transparent.
We're not building this for ourselves.
We're building this because we believe can change things.

Can someone use our work and make money out of it?
Yes, they can. But that's okay.
What we care about is to do our best to improve education.
Everything else is a distraction.
If someone else is using our work to improve education,
then our mission is accomplished, even if we don't make money out of it.

## Ownership

We don't expect others to tell us what to do.
We go ahead and do it.
It doesn't matter if things aren't perfect.
They never will be.
We take responsibility for we do things.

Is there a bug in our software?
We don't wait for someone else to report it.
We go ahead and create an issue or start a discussion about it.
Is something wrong in this document?
We don't complain about it.
We edit this file and suggest something better.

Ownership to us is a default to action.
We don't expect others to do things for us.
We go ahead and do it.
We say what we're thinking and we always seek to improve things.

That doesn't mean our suggestions and comments are always going to be accepted.
It's normal for disagreements to occur.
But all comments will be welcome and discussed.
Eventually, a decision will be made.
We'll accept that decision and work together to make it work.
Even when we disagree with it.
We can (and should) always revisit those decisions and disagreements over time, though.
