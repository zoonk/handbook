# Values

Our values are what care about when working with each other.
Everything we do should have our values at heart.

## Kindness

Be kind in everything you do. Being kind means:

- Respecting and understanding each other.
- Helping other people.
- Being patient.
- Having empathy.
- Being polite.
- Listening to people you disagree with.
- Avoiding gossip, sarcasm, passive agressive comments, and disrespectful jokes.
- Using [nonviolent communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7TONauJGfc).
- Respecting our [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Being kind is especially important in environments like ours where [asynchronous communication is the default](./how-we-work.md).
If someone isn't kind to you, please report them to people@zoonk.org or send an anonymous feedback to https://forms.gle/48UjFHCFByxCfd12A.

## Transparency

We believe education should be free and open. Therefore, everything we do must be as transparent as possible.
Being transparent allows everyone to know what's happening because we don't have "closed door" meetings.
This means all decisions and communications should be made in open forums such as GitHub Discussions, Issues, and Pull Requests.

How to be transparent:

- Communicate in public. Instead of sending an email, [start a new discussion](https://github.com/zoonk/handbook/discussions/new).
- Be clear about your intentions (say what you mean).
- Overcommunicate. Don't wait for things to be perfect to share your work. Do it from the moment you start.
- Don't use email, Slack, WhatsApp, or other private channels to discuss work.

The exception to those rules is when dealing with personal and/or sensitive data.
In those cases, please DO NOT post in public forums.
