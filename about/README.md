# About us

Zoonk is a small, bootstrapped open-source project dedicated to make **learning** more **fun**, **hands-on**, and **accessible** to everyone.

## Why are we building this?

We believe education is key to create a more diverse society where everyone has equal opportunities.
However, education isn't accessible to everyone for different reasons. In many places, education is:

- [Expensive](https://www.theedadvocate.org/high-school-dropout-rate-causes-and-costs/).
- [Boring](https://www.learningliftoff.com/causes-and-cures-for-classroom-boredom/).
- [Not applicable to solve real-life problems](https://thermtide.com/11001/popular/schools-lack-necessary-real-world-lessons/).
- [Not diverse](https://www.edutopia.org/article/troubling-lack-diversity-educational-materials).
- [Not succeeding in teaching critical thinking](https://thetylt.com/culture/schools-teaching-critical-thinking).
- [More focused on memorization than problem-solving](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00061.2005).

[Prince Ea published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8) that shares what we think of the current state of education.
Hopefully, this will change in the future and Zoonk will no longer be necessary.

## Why those things are a problem?

## How can we fix them?

## How do we know when our job will be done?

Our job will be done when I can check all the boxes below:

- [ ] <<update>>

We know some of things require deeper changes to society and won't be fixed by us.
But we want to give a contribution to get there.
This could be a direct contribution through our projects or an indirect one by inspiring others to work on those areas.

What matters to us is getting those boxes checked. It doesn't matter who will make that happen. We value [no ego](./values.md).

## Are you planning to replace teachers?

## Who are us?

Right now,
