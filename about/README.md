# About us

Zoonk is a small, bootstrapped open-source project dedicated to make **learning** more **fun**, **hands-on**, **diverse**, and **accessible** to everyone.

- [Values](./values.md)
- [How we work](../how-we-work)

## Why are we building this?

We believe education is key to create a more diverse society where everyone has equal opportunities.
However, education isn't accessible to everyone for different reasons. In many places, education is:

- [Expensive](https://www.theedadvocate.org/high-school-dropout-rate-causes-and-costs/).
- [Boring](https://www.learningliftoff.com/causes-and-cures-for-classroom-boredom/).
- [Not applicable to solve real-life problems](https://thermtide.com/11001/popular/schools-lack-necessary-real-world-lessons/).
- [Not diverse](https://www.edutopia.org/article/troubling-lack-diversity-educational-materials).
- [Not succeeding in teaching critical thinking](https://thetylt.com/culture/schools-teaching-critical-thinking).
- [More focused on memorization than problem-solving](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00061.2005).

[Prince Ea published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8) that shares what we think of the current state of education.

## Why those things are a problem?

If education is **expensive**, fewer people get formal education and many students dropout from school.
By dropping out, they have [fewer chances of succeeding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262308885_Long-term_labour_market_consequences_of_dropping_out_of_upper_secondary_school_Minority_disadvantages) in our current system.
Plus, it has a [negative effect in society as a whole](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338665702_The_economics_of_high_school_dropouts).

If education is **boring**, fewer students engage in learning.
Considering our society is changing rapidly, [lifelong learning is already one of the most important skills](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812019416?via%3Dihub).
People need to be motivated to learn new things. Making it fun is one way to accomplish it.

If education is **not applicable to solve real-life problems**,
then many students have trouble understanding why learning is important at all.
Why should they spend their time in school or college if that's not going to help them get a job?
This also [contributes for them to drop out of school](https://www.learningliftoff.com/why-kids-drop-out-of-high-school-and-how-to-prevent-it/).

If education is **not diverse**, then minority groups [don't feel like they belong](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/reports/the-representation-of-social-groups-in-u-s-educational-materials-and-why-it-matter/) there.
By having more diversity in our schools and learning materials,
we can improve the lives of minorities and also help other students
[become more open-minded and empathetic](https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/importance-of-cultural-diversity-in-classroom).
This will help us prevent the [rise of hate crimes](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2022/02/14/hate-crime-increase-2021-asian-american-),
creating a more tolerante and welcoming society for all.

If education is **not succeeding in teaching critical thinking**, then we see the [rise of misinformation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517441113).
Thanks to how easy social media made to share fake news, misinformation is becoming a growing issue.
It can facilitate the spreading of diseases as we've seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.
It also makes harder to fight diseases thanks to conspiracity theories and anti-science movements.

If education is **more focused on memorization than problem-solving**,
then we're not preparing future generations for the needs of the 21st century.
We have all the information we need in our hands now thanks to smartphones.
We don't need memorization anymore. [Teaching problem-solving](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/the-skills-needed-to-survive-the-robot-invasion-of-the-workplace) is much important
to avoid [technological unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment).

## How can we fix them?

We don't know. It's a hard task and Zoonk alone won't fix all those issues but we're creating this project to help.
It's going to involve a lot of [trial and error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error).
There are no guarantees we'll succeed but we'll keep trying new things until we can create some positive impact in the education system.

This is a collaborative effort, though.
