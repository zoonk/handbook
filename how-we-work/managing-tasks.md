# How we manage tasks

We value [transparency](../about/values.md#transparency) and [ownership](../about/values.md#ownership).
This means all our tasks are public.
Anyone can see what we're working on and encouraged to pick a task they'd like to work on.

The [projects page](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/projects?type=beta) shows all the tasks that need to be done for each project.
They're organized in the following manner:

|Board|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Backlog|All tasks that haven't been prioritized yet. We add ideas and future features here. It doesn't mean we'll work on them. We add all ideas here to keep track of them. To propose a new idea, [start a discussion](./managing-discussions.md).|
|Todo|Approved tasks. You can start working on them right away.|
|In Progress|Tasks that are actively being worked on. After you start working on a task, move it to this column.|
|In Review|Tasks that are partially finished and waiting for someone to review them. After you [open a PR for a task](./managing-prs.md), move it to this column.|
|Done|Tasks that are completed and pushed to the `main` branch. It doesn't necessarily mean it's released to production yet.|

## Bugs, new features, brainstorming, and feedback

If you'd like to report a bug, suggest a feature, brainstorm ideas, or give us some feedback,
please [start a discussion](./managing-discussions.md) in the relevant project.
If you don't know what's the most appropriate project to start a discussion,
feel free to [start a discussion on the organization page](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions).
We'll redirect it to the appropriate project.
