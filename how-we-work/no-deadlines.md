# No deadlines

We believe (most of the times) deadlines are made up dates to pressure people to deliver something.
We don't want that here.
That's why we don't have deadlines.

We try to iterate fast and ship things often.
However, we ship something when we're confident that's good work.
We don't rush a task just because it's the end of a cycle or sprint.
We don't have cycles or sprints.
We work on something, we ship it, and we move on to the next task.
