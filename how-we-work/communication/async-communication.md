# Asynchronous communication

We work using [asynchronous communication](https://async.twist.com/asynchronous-communication/):

> Simply put, **asynchronous communication is when you send a message without expecting an immediate response**.
> For example, you send an email. I open and respond to the email several hours later.
>
> In contrast, **synchronous – or real-time – communication is when you send a message and
> the recipient processes the information and responds immediately**.
> In-person communication, like meetings, are examples of purely synchronous communication.
> You say something, I receive the information as you say it, and respond to the information right away.
>
> But digital forms of communication, like real-time chat messaging, can be synchronous too.
> You send a message, I get a notification and open up Slack to read the message and respond to what you said in near real-time.

## Why we use asynchronous communication

### Flexibility

By using asynchronous communication, nobody needs to know where or when other people are working.
Are you traveling to spend more time with your family? That's okay, you can work from there.
Are you busy helping your kids with their homework? That's okay, you can work later.
Are you feeling sad and need to take a break? That's okay, work when you're feeling better.

In theory, we could have those things using synchronous communication but we feel bad
when we need to ask for a break, to leave, or to arrive late.
We shouldn't need to explain ourselves to anyone.
Using asynchronous communication, work carry on as usual and our tasks will be there when we're ready to work again.
No need to explain ourselves to other people.

### Transparency

[Transparency is one of core values](../about/values.md#transparency).
We want everything we do to be open, transparent, and clear.
That's not possible when we're using synchronous communication.

If we discuss a strategy over a call, there's always some context lost in there.
If a group makes a decision alone, other people won't know why the full story of why that decision was made.
We don't want decisions happening behind closed doors.

By using asynchronous communication, our entire work and thought process is available for anyone else to see.
We don't have anything to hide.
If we make a mistake, we must be accountable for it.
This is only possible when everything is clear, open, and transparent.

### Documentation

Being transparent also helps us to have everything documented.
We don't need to worry about losing information or missing processes.
Everything is written down and can be searched.
If something happens to someone, their knowledge isn't lost (the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)).

### Global work

Let's say we're working synchronously.
We have two people working on the same project.
One of them is working from Brazil and the other is based in Japan.
Coordinating timezones will be a nightmare for them.
Someone will have to rearrange their life to make it work.
It doesn't have to be like that, though.

Using asynchronous communication, it doesn't matter where we are.
We can work from Brazil or Japan.
Whenever we're ready, work will be there waiting for us.

### Well-being

Asynchronous communication means it doesn't matter if we're an early bird or a night owl.
We're in control of our life. We adapt work to our routine and not the other way around.

By doing so, we can better control our life.
We can spend time with our kids during the day.
We can even go for a drink if we're feeling like it.
No need to worry about a boss wondering where we are or if someone needs us ASAP.
There is no ASAP here, by the way. We just enjoy our life. Work can wait.

### Planning

Asynchronous communication also leads to better planning.
As mentioned earlier, there is no ASAP here.
We're not a healthcare project. Nobody is dying.
If we need something ASAP is because we didn't plan well, so we'll have to wait and do a better planning next time.
This is about respecting each other's time.

It also means we have more time to think about things.
Instead of rushing into a meeting unprepared,
we can join a conversation at any time and share our point of view,
thinking deeper about the subject, sharing references, etc.
We wouldn't be able to do those things during a meeting because it requires an immediate response.
Ultimately, this leads to a higher quality work.

Sometimes we'll depend on someone else's work to continue our task.
However, that shouldn't block us from working on other things.
There will always be work available to do.
We can move to another task or answer a pending discussion while waiting for the other person to answer us.
If we really don't have any work on your plate, then good for us!
Let's just go enjoy whatever we like to do during our free time. :)

### Focus

Synchronous communication is full of distractions.
At the office, people will ask us for "one minute" of our attention.
But it's never just one minute.
[Distractions are expensive](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html),
they [make us lose focus](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jobhdp/v109y2009i2p168-181.html).
It's hard to do [deep work](https://blog.doist.com/deep-work/) in those situations.

We could use tools like Slack but they're provide the same kind of distractions.
Our workflow is interrupted and it's hard to focus again.
We believe being able to focus is essential to do quality work.
And asynchronous communication is essential to focus because we don't have interruptions.

## How we use asynchronous communication

Asynchronous communication has its own challenges.
It requires a different way of approaching work.
That's why it's important to have [ownership](../about/values.md#ownership).
Async communication won't work if we wait for someone to tell us what to do.
We must take the lead.

Here, at Zoonk, we use GitHub to manage our asynchronous communication.
There are three things we need to check out every workday:

- Are there any [issues assigned to me](https://github.com/issues/assigned)?
- Are there any [pull requests assigned to me](https://github.com/pulls/assigned)?
- Are there any [discussions requiring my input](https://github.com/notifications?query=is%3Adiscussion+reason%3Amention+)?

If we don't have any tasks assigned to us or discussions requiring our input, we can pick another task to work on.
We can find all tasks on the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/projects/11).
All tasks with the "Todo" status are redy to be worked on.

## What if I don't like asynchronous communication?

We understand asynchronous work isn't ideal for everyone.
Unfortunately, that's a core part of how we work for the reasons we mentioned above.
Maybe we can accomodate synchronous work for some people in the future but we don't have the resources to do it right now.

## When should we use synchronous communication?

Only for non-work things, like bonding.
We use synchronous communication to get to know each other, to have fun.
But, for discussing work-related matters, we stick to asynchronous communication.
