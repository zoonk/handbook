# Asking questions

Let's say you have a question about the content of this page.
You might be tempted to send a private message to the page author.

### Why you may want to send a private message

- It's just a quick question.
- It feels faster.
- You feel your question could be dumb and you don't want to embarrass yourself.
- You don't want other people to judge you.

### Why that's a problem

#### Transparency

When you send someone a question in private, the other person will also answer you in private.
This could lead to a back-and-forth and to a decision-making process that isn't visible to other people.
By having decisions made behind "closed doors", we don't fully understand the motivation and intention behind those decisions.
If someone picks up that work, they won't know why certain decisions were made because the discussions were held privately.

#### Documentation

Those "closed doors" decisions are especially bad for documentation.
One may suggest to document the process after the private conversation but, in reality, that rarely gets done.
Even when it is documented, other people won't have the context that lead you to the decision in the first place.

#### It's rarely a quick question

It may be a quick question to you but not the person who needs to answer it.
