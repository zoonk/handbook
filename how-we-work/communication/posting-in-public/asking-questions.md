# Asking questions

Let's say you have a question about the content of this page.
You might be tempted to send a private message to the page author.

### Why you may want to send a private message

- It's just a quick question.
- It feels faster.
- You feel your question could be "dumb" and you don't want to embarrass yourself.
- You don't want other people to judge you.

### Why that's a problem

#### Transparency

When you send someone a question in private, the other person will also answer you in private.
This could lead to a back-and-forth and to a decision-making process that isn't visible to other people.
By having decisions made behind "closed doors", we don't fully understand the motivation and intention behind those decisions.
If someone picks up that work, they won't know why certain decisions were made because the discussions were held privately.

#### Documentation

Those "closed doors" decisions are especially bad for documentation.
One may suggest to document the process after the private conversation but, in reality, that rarely gets done.
Even when it is documented, other people won't have the context that lead you to the decision in the first place.

#### Answering the same thing multiple times

If the conversation is happening in private, there's no record of it in our public forums.
When someone else asks similar questions, the other person will have to answer it again.
As a project grows, that's not sustainable anymore since
you'd have to spend chunks periods of time answering the same questions over and over again.

_"But what if my team is small? We won't spend too much time answering questions!"_
It doesn't matter. It's better to start practicting this from the beggining.
It will make everyone's lives easier when onboarding new people.
It may feel like a pain now but it will be good in the long-term.

#### It's rarely a quick question

It may be a quick question to you but not the person who needs to answer it.
They're working on something else and they have to stop what they're doing to answer you.
Then, they need to think about the answer.
It means they have to switch context to understand the problem (e.g. Come to this page to see what you're referring to).
By the time they got back to their work, they've already lost their previous thought process.
It feels faster to you but not the person who had to interrupt their work to answer you.

This issue doesn't happen when we ask questions in public because anyone can answer our question and
we can set aside a chunk of time every day to answer questions.

#### "I need to be online" problem

Asking private questions creates a feeling the we need to be online all the time because there could be someone who needs me right now.
When we embrace asynchronous communication and ask questions in public, we know other people won't expect an answer right away.
So, it doesn't matter I'm online or not.
I can enjoy life and come back to work whenever I feel like working.

Since anyone can answer that same question, it may happen that the question is actually answered by time I'm back online.
So, sometimes, you can even get a faster answer by asking in public.

#### There are no "dumb" questions

People often don't like to work in public because they're afraid of being judged for asking "dumb" questions.
That's a clear sign of a toxic culture.
There are no "dumb" questions. You should not even use the "dumb" word to begin with.

Nobody's perfect. Nobody knows everything.
We'll often make mistakes.
We'll often say wrong things because we either lack context or exposure.
Those things are perfectly normal and they happen to even most experienced professionals.

If someone says your question is "stupid", "dumb", or something similar, please report them to people@zoonk.org.

### What you should do instead

_Okay, I shouldn't send private messages to ask questions. What should I do instead?_

Use our [discussion forums](../../managing-discussions.md). Every repository has a `Discussions` page.
Whenever you have a question, suggestion, or would just like to share something, start a new conversation there.
