# Posting in public

[Transparency](../../about/values.md#transparency) is key to what we do.
Therefore, our entire communication process is done in public.

## Examples

- [Asking questions](./asking-questions.md)

## When to NOT post in public

Don't post in public when dealing with sensitive information. For example:

- Personal data such as phone number, address, email address, date of birth, documents, etc.
- Personal feedback.
- [GDPR's senstive data](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/legal-grounds-processing-data/sensitive-data/what-personal-data-considered-sensitive_en).

In those cases, you can use:

- Private repositories.
- Private Google Drive documents.
- Email.
