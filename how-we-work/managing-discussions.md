# How we manage discussions

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for our work communication. 
Each repository has a `Discussions` page.
You can go there to report bugs, suggest features, brainstorm ideas, ask questions, and send us feedback.

If you don't know which project you should go to, please feel free to post on the [organization's discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/zoonk/discussions). We'll redirect your post to the relevant repository/project.

Since [we work asynchronously](./async-communication.md) and [we value transparency](../about/values#transparency),
we prefer to have all conversations on GitHub Discussions.
Therefore, we don't use email, Slack, or similar tools very often.
The exception is when dealing with sensitive data (i.e. user information, personal feedback, conflicts, etc.).

## Finding discussions

As mentioned earlier, each repository/project has its own discussions forum.
There, you can find everything that was ever discussed about that project.
All decisions made will be either there or in the repository's `Issues` page.

If you need to find a discussion created by a specific person, you can use [filters](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-discussions#search-by-author) for that.
If you need to find discussions you were mentioned in, you can go to the [notifications page](https://github.com/notifications?query=is%3Adiscussion+reason%3Amention+) since you'll receive a notification every time someone mentions you.

**Important:** If you're a project lead, it's your responsability to follow and answer all discussions for a project.
You can do so by watching discussions in the repository you manage:

- Go to the repository page.
- Click on the `watch`/`unwatch` button.
- Click on the `custom` menu.
- Select the `Discussions` option.
- Confirm your selection by clicking on the `Apply` button.
