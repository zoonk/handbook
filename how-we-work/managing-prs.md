# How we manage pull requests

Every time we finish [working on a task](./managing-tasks.md), we need to open a pull request to publish our changes to the `main` branch.
A pull request is like a request to make changes to a project.
You can learn more about it in our [Git guide for non-coders](./git-for-non-coders.md).
